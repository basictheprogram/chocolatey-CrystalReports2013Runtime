    <description>
        * SAP Crystal Reports allows a report designer to bring data in from various sources
        to create a document where the data is formatted into a design of their choosing,
        such as an invoice, sales or operational report, marketing letter or some sort of
        analytic.

        * SAP Crystal Server provides a platform through which you can share documents (such
        as SAP Crystal Reports files) with end users. With SAP Crystal Server you can schedule
        reports to be pushed out to recipients as PDF email attachments, or access the reports
        securely and refresh the data entering parameters using a browser or mobile app
        (download the free app from Apple App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sap-businessobjects-mobile/id441208302
        or from Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sap.mobi).

        * SAP Crystal Reports for Visual Studio and SAP Crystal Reports for Eclipse are free add-ons
        for developers using .NET and Java respectively to embed reporting capabilities into their
        applications.

        * SAP Crystal Reports Viewer is a free desktop application (Windows or Mac) allowing
        recipients of SAP Crystal Reports files (.rpt file extension) to open the document and
        interact with the data saved with the file, including search, drill-down, print and
        export – but not refresh.

        * SAP Crystal Reports for Enterprise is an edition of report designer which uses a meta
        layer for data sources (a universe) for report design. The software for SAP Crystal Reports
        for Enterprise is included with SAP Crystal Server, Edge or BOE and the installation
        requires a SAP Crystal Reports keycode of the same version as the BI Platform (see table
        for version information).

        * SAP Crystal Reports for SAP Business One allows users of SAP Business One to create
        pixel perfect reports and dashboards by connecting exclusively the SAP Business One
        data model with the SAP Crystal Reports environment. You can launch SAP Crystal reports
        and dashboards directly from SAP Business One. If you want to connect to additional data
        sources including SAP Business One data sources, you will need to acquire SAP Crystal
        Reports 2020.
